Required skills
================

I'd suggest that you have the following skills to proceed with this project —

* Familiarity with your operating system of choice, and some technical level of computing experience. 
  
  * Most of the things you'll need to do in the course of building this project can *probably* be done in Windows, but a shell script for code deployment to the Pico is included in the repository so Linux is probably preferable.
  * You'll need some kind of Home Assistance instance to get the most out of this project in terms of automation so familiarity with virtualisation could be beneficial if you want to run it in a VM or container.
* Rudimentary experience of electronics, and the ability to solder. You'll need to wire together some of the components in the BOM (Bill Of Materials).
* Some coding experience in general (especially object-oriented Python) would be beneficial, but coding on your part should be largely unnecessary — important configurables are held within ``.conf`` files.
* Familiarity with OpenSCAD would be beneficial but again, necessary changes on your part should be minimal and important configurables can be changed directly within the OpenSCAD UI.
* 3D printing experience, you should be familiar with standard concepts such as slicing, fill percentages, supports and the properties of different printing materials.
